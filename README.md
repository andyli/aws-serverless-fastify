## Description

A port of the AWSLABS [aws-serverless-express](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express) library tailor made for the
[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) web framework. Inspired by wanting to use the Fastify gracefully in [Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com/) projects with Lambda. Plus it's called Fastify, how cool is that!

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install aws-serverless-fastify
```

## Example

I will provide an example. Soon.

## Performance

Not meant to be exhaustive by any means but here are some basic load tests comparisons through API Gateway. [aws-serverless-fastify](https://benMain.github.io/aws-serverless-fastify/performance/aws-serverless-fastify-results.html) versus [aws-serverless-express](https://benMain.github.io/aws-serverless-fastify/performance/aws-serverless-express-results.html)

## Support

Pull Requests are welcome! We just thought this was a cool idea to simplify!
Important: Commits should follow Angluar conventional-changelog format :)
